     * <b>Problem description</b>
     * <p>
     * Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated
     * by adding the previous two terms.
     * By starting with <i>1</i> and <i>2</i>, the first <i>10</i>
     * terms will be:
     * <br />
     * <br />
     * <i>1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,...</i>
     * <br />
     * <br />
     * By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence
     * whose values do not exceed 4'000'000,
     * find the sum of the even-valued terms.
     * </p>
