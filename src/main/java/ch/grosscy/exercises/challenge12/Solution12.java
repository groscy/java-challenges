     * This challenge requires you to optimize your code if you get stuck follow

     * <br/>
     * Implementation Hints:
     * - Use the closed form for generating your triangle numbers
     * - You don't have to search every number when you check for divisors
     * - If you do not search every number you will have to calculate them another way
     * - Leverage data structure to avoid duplicates
